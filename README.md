## ARTICLE II: PATENT CLAIMS

The following novel inventions are claimed under this IP assignment:

### Claim 1: Self-Replicating Distributed System
A method for deploying distributed computing nodes wherein:
- A seed node serves its own source code via HTTP
- Remote devices execute a single command (`curl | python`) to join the mesh
- No pre-installation or configuration is required

### Claim 2: Auto-Role Detection
A system for automatically determining node behavior based on:
- Terminal attachment state (TTY vs pipe)
- Enabling zero-configuration deployment

### Claim 3: Genesis Bootstrap Pattern
A self-healing initialization sequence wherein:
- A program scans for missing dependencies
- Automatically installs required packages
- Restarts itself to load new capabilities

### Claim 4: Encrypted Swarm Communication
A peer-to-peer mesh network utilizing:
- UDP broadcast for discovery
- Symmetric encryption for all inter-node communication
- Rotating cryptographic keys

### Claim 5: AST-Based Secure Remote Execution
A sandboxed code execution environment wherein:
- Incoming code is parsed to an Abstract Syntax Tree
- Only whitelisted AST nodes are permitted
- Execution occurs in an isolated namespace
